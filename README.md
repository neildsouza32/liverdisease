## ðŸš€ Liver Disease Predictor App

### About the App
The Liver Disease Predictor App is a web application built using Flask that takes user input and predicts the likelihood of liver disease. The app is powered by a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset, and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the dataset is available in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Features
- User-friendly interface to input relevant information
- Accurate prediction of liver disease risk based on the input
- Seamless integration with the backend machine learning model
- Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Saadat-Khalid/liver-disease-predictor.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
4. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)
